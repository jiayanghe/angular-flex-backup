	      During our time as researchers, we noticed that some QDAS are feature-rich but highly unintuitive, often requiring days or weeks just to get started (much less do anything). Others are more intuitive but so clunky and lacking in features that theyâ€™re unusable. Many of the researchers that we interviewed said they ended up doing analyses by hand out of sheer frustration with all QDAS!
